# Changelog

## v0.3.0 — Empirical calibration layer
- Added current user-supplied CBDC paper n=81 published empirical anchor.
- Added provenance-separated parameter registry: estimated / estimated_inconclusive / literature_bounded / author_calibrated / design.
- Added empirical episode import and local OLS refit pipeline; partial imports cannot silently replace the published profile.
- CDRS scenarios now use the published concentration×shock channel and the paper's ±40% robustness envelope.
- Added empirical readiness to dashboard, approvals and generated reports.
- Evidence Level A now requires a locally complete episode panel plus human validation; published-anchor-only runs are capped below A.
- Added migration 0005 and deterministic empirical regression tests.
